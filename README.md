<!--- ### What is growth mindset?

**Growth mindset** to me is a combination of **effort**, **challenges**, **consistency**, and **self-reflection**. This mindset of starting then challenging oneself to do a little more each time until you get to your goal. Effort can be the bare minimum or the maximum, but the goal here is making the step to begin/start. Through starting and challenging yourself each and everytime you get into a rhythm of consistency. Of course during this time failure or hiccups will occur and this is where self reflection matters. Self relection is not to say you made an error or that you've become too fixated on one path, but rather allowing yourself to take a step back and look at your journey. The goal of self-reflection can be for criticism, joy, or just a break. 

### Self-Reminders:
1. Consistency: Getting a normal sleep/work schedule. Have dedicated time for studying/working. This doesn't include extra/after-hours studying. By having set times or allocating time parameters each day/week I am giving myself a guarenteed amount of time to study without interruptions.

1. Effort: I know there are time when I don't want to study or work, but even putting in the bare minimum is better than no effort. A small step is still a step at the end of the day. Not putting in any work just prolongs my journey to my goal. I want to finish coding bootcamp to re-start my life and live it. ***Small steps = good / No steps = bad***. 

1. Have fun with this whole journey. This is something new and from what I've been hearing the end goal is worth all this work. There are people I want to catch up to and through tech I can. **Enjoy and make the most out of this experience!** :frog:
