# Questions:

1. What is an ```Expression``` in Javascript?

- block of code that evaluates to a value

1. Why would we use a loop in our code?

- Allows multiple line of repeating code or a repetitively task to be written in less lines on code. Instead of writing 100 lines of code to figure out if a input/outcome is true or false a loop allows us to write it in less (in some cases even one). 

1. When does a ```for``` loop stop executing?

- When the condition is false

1. How many times will a ```while``` loop execute?

- As much time until the condition is false 

# Notes:

```for``` loop executes: 

- **initialization** executes if any. 
- **condition** expression is evaluated. If the condition is true the loop executes. Otherwise the ```for``` loop stops.
- **statement** executes. 
- **afterthough** executes if present. Curly brackets { } to group multiple statements.

```
for (initialization; condition; afterthought)
    statement
```
```while``` statement: executes as long as a specific condition is met. If not then current loop will stop and statement control is passed to the following loop

**infinite loops**: When the condition of the loop never becomes false.
