# Reading Notes:
- **version control** is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. 
    - One can revert a file or project to a previous version
    - Track modifications / Modifying individuals / Compare changes / Mistakes with files can be rectified
- Local Version Control : Local VCS : **One database** on your hard disk

- Centralized Version Control: CVCS : **Single** server / Can be access by multiple clients
- Distributed Version Control: DVCS : Allows for mirrored repositories (data backup). Helps prevent loss if a CVCS goes down
